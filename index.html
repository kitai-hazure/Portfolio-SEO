            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>
              I am a goal-oriented person. I work hard and work smart to reach my goal. My short term goals are to build upon the coding languages I have begun to learn and eventually take part in events and hackathons, I also want to keep my fitness levels up and try to play basketball at a higher level. I  enjoy meeting new people and getting to know them, so my goal is to make as many friends as possible as soon as I start my offline mode of  classes.

             Sports has been an integral part of my life so my long term goal will be to promote sports amongst the youngsters, I have already started my journey by teaching some of the kids in my society the game of basketball. I also want to become succesfull coder and entrepreneur in the future. Listening to many ted talks has motivated me. I would love it if I ever were given a chance to become a ted speaker.
